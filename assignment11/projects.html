<p>Retro Upgrade is the first game I ever worked on. The game is a more upgraded version of the game Asteriods. The part I worked on for this game was the music/sound effects and the testing while my other teamates did the graphics and code. The game was made with the software called Game Salad. Want to check out the recorded gameplay click here to watch.</p>
